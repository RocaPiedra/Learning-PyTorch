# Learning-PyTorch

Starting from the available tutorials at https://pytorch.org/tutorials

This will include my progress using the PyTorch library

The objective is to develop machine learning skills towards explainability

TensorBoard gives very good tools to comprehend the net. Now is time to test if it is possible to do feature extraction in an easier way. Initial goal was to give user information but maybe this way we can obtain good insights for programmers. Later it is possible to progress towards obtaining user friendly information with saliency maps (if possible in somewhat real time).
